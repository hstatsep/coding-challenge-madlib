# Coding Challenge: Madlib

If you don't know what a madlib is, click [here](http://www.redkid.net/madlibs/).

Using your knowledge of variables, strings, `prompt()`, and `document.write()`, create your own madlib! Write your code in `script.js`.

## Requirements
* Use `prompt()` to collect at least 5 pieces of information from the user. Make sure to save their input as variables!
* Use `document.write()` to put their inputs into your own silly madlib!

## Optional
* Use `alert()` to welcome the user to the Madlib before you start asking them questions.
* Use `style.css` to give your page some flare!
